AnimBuilder
============

Traditional 2D animation creation tool. Qt based.
I will focus on raster graphics first, because it's more friendly to artist.

The goal is to create a tool which improves timing and spacing skills of artists.

Current project is in prototype stage. Features will change frequently.

Features
============
1. Pen: good line quality, real-time smoothing, tablet support
2. Canvas: panning(space), rotating(shift), zooming(ctrl), reset(T)
3. Timeline: frame add (dbclick), move (drag)
4. Flood fill: auto expanding, visible content based
5. Trace layer: record & playback mouse movement. Fast timing utility.
6. Color: HSV color ring, color picker(alt)
7. Hold shortcuts: Eraser(E), Filled Region(R)
8. Onion skins: per-layer control
9. Playback: next(G), prev(F), play/stop(A)
10. Hide/Show UI: F4
11. Blend mode: normal, behind, erase, multiply, add
